# PK (Project Kit) Configuration File
# Location: ~/.config/pk/config.toml
#
# This file is OPTIONAL. PK works perfectly with defaults.
# Only create this file if you need to customize directory paths.

[paths]
# Customize where PK looks for projects
# All paths support ~ for home directory expansion
# If not specified, PK uses these defaults:
#   projects    = "~/projects"
#   archive     = "~/archive"
#   scratch     = "~/scratch"
#   scriptorium = "~/scriptorium"

# Example: Use "work" instead of "projects"
# projects = "~/work"

# Example: Bundle everything under a workspace directory
# projects = "~/workspace/projects"
# archive = "~/workspace/archive"
# scratch = "~/workspace/scratch"
# scriptorium = "~/workspace/scriptorium"

# Example: Separate personal and work projects
# projects = "~/dev/personal"
# archive = "~/dev/archive"
# scratch = "~/dev/scratch"

# Notes:
# - Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)
# - PK will auto-heal stale paths after server migration
# - Run `pk doctor` to validate your configuration
